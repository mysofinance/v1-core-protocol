## Methods

### borrow

```solidity
function borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf) external nonpayable
```



*Allows users to borrow a specific `amount` of the reserve underlying asset, provided that the borrower already deposited enough collateral, or he was given enough allowance by a credit delegator on the corresponding debt token (StableDebtToken or VariableDebtToken) - E.g. User borrows 100 USDC passing as `onBehalfOf` his own address, receiving the 100 USDC in his wallet   and 100 stable/variable debt tokens, depending on the `interestRateMode`*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| asset | address | The address of the underlying asset to borrow |
| amount | uint256 | The amount to be borrowed |
| interestRateMode | uint256 | The interest rate mode at which the user wants to borrow: 1 for Stable, 2 for Variable |
| referralCode | uint16 | Code used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards.   0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-man |
| onBehalfOf | address | Address of the user who will receive the debt. Should be the address of the borrower itself calling the function if he wants to borrow against his own collateral, or the address of the credit delegator if he has been given credit delegation allowance* |

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode) external nonpayable
```



*Deposits an `amount` of underlying asset into the reserve, receiving in return overlying aTokens. - E.g. User deposits 100 USDC and gets in return 100 aUSDC*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| asset | address | The address of the underlying asset to deposit |
| amount | uint256 | The amount to be deposited |
| onBehalfOf | address | The address that will receive the aTokens, same as msg.sender if the user   wants to receive them on his own wallet, or a different address if the beneficiary of aTokens   is a different wallet |
| referralCode | uint16 | Code used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards.   0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-man* |

### flashLoan

```solidity
function flashLoan(address receiverAddress, address[] assets, uint256[] amounts, uint256[] modes, address onBehalfOf, bytes params, uint16 referralCode) external nonpayable
```



*Allows smartcontracts to access the liquidity of the pool within one transaction, as long as the amount taken plus a fee is returned. IMPORTANT There are security concerns for developers of flashloan receiver contracts that must be kept into consideration. For further details please visit https://developers.aave.com*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| receiverAddress | address | The address of the contract receiving the funds, implementing the IFlashLoanReceiver interface |
| assets | address[] | The addresses of the assets being flash-borrowed |
| amounts | uint256[] | The amounts amounts being flash-borrowed |
| modes | uint256[] | Types of the debt to open if the flash loan is not returned:   0 -&gt; Don&#39;t open any debt, just revert if funds can&#39;t be transferred from the receiver   1 -&gt; Open debt at stable rate for the value of the amount flash-borrowed to the `onBehalfOf` address   2 -&gt; Open debt at variable rate for the value of the amount flash-borrowed to the `onBehalfOf` address |
| onBehalfOf | address | The address  that will receive the debt in the case of using on `modes` 1 or 2 |
| params | bytes | Variadic packed params to pass to the receiver as extra information |
| referralCode | uint16 | Code used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards.   0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-man* |

### getReserveData

```



*Returns the user account data across all the reserves*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

### repay

```solidity
function repay(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 rateMode, address onBehalfOf) external nonpayable returns (uint256)
```

Repays a borrowed `amount` on a specific reserve, burning the equivalent debt tokens owned - E.g. User repays 100 USDC, burning 100 variable/stable debt tokens of the `onBehalfOf` address



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| asset | address | The address of the borrowed underlying asset previously borrowed |
| amount | uint256 | The amount to repay - Send the value type(uint256).max in order to repay the whole debt for `asset` on the specific `debtMode` |
| rateMode | uint256 | The interest rate mode at of the debt the user wants to repay: 1 for Stable, 2 for Variable |
| onBehalfOf | address | Address of the user who will get his debt reduced/removed. Should be the address of the user calling the function if he wants to reduce/remove his own debt, or the address of any other other borrower whose debt should be removed |
